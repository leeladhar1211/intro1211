    "###### Finding Patterns of Text With Regular Expressions\n",
    " \\d in a regex stands for a digit character—that is, any single numeral 0 to 9.we have to import re module to work with python reg expressions To create a Regex object that matches the phone number pattern, enter the following into the interactive shell. (Remember that \\d means “a digit character” and \\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d is the regular expression for the correct phone number pattern.)\n",
    " Remember that escape characters in Python use the backslash (\\). The string value '\\n' represents a single newline character, not a backslash followed by a lowercase n. You need to enter the escape character \\\\ to print a single backslash. So '\\\\n' is the string that represents a backslash followed by a lowercase n. However, by putting an r before the first quote of the string value, you can mark the string as a raw string, which does not escape characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since regular expressions frequently use backslashes in them, it is convenient to pass raw strings to the re.compile() function instead of typing extra backslashes. Typing r'\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d' is much easier than typing '\\\\d\\\\d\\\\d-\\\\d\\\\d\\\\d-\\\\d\\\\d\\\\d\\\\d'\n"
